This is a Laravel app that connects to Google Calendar using a Google Developer API key that you can request from Google and put in your .env file.

It calculates when your next paycheck is going to be, based on the Slovenian holiday calendar. You can change the Calendar ID to a calendar in your country.

It assumes your paycheck is on the 10th workday of the month. The year and month can be selected from a dropdown.
